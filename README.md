WYBMNRedux
=======================

## What is WYBMNRedux?

WYBMNRedux is a rewrite of the abandoned [WillYouBeMyNeighbor] (http://www.curse.com/ws-addons/wildstar/221549-willyoubemyneighbor). It has been rewritten from the ground up with one singular goal in mind: PERFORMANCE.

Even though the original addon still works as of this writing, it has long since been abandoned and is currently suffering from a number of performance issues. WYBMNRedux tries to alleviate that both by utilising a somewhat optimised code and logic as well as greatly reducing the addon communication channel spam.

## How do I use it?

You can install the add-on from Curse using either the website or the Curse client.
After the add-on has been installed, you can show or hide the window by typing '/wybmnr' in the chat.

You can configure the add-on by choosing 'Configure' in the addon list under WYBMNRedux or clicking an appropriate button in the addon gui itself.

Most of the options are self explanatory. One option that is worth mentioning is the 'WillYouBeMyNeighbor compatibility mode'. With this option checked (default) WYBMNRedux acts as a drop in replacement for WillYouBeMyNeighbor. With this option turned off, you will only be able to see WYBMNRedux users, however the communication spam is reduced significantly. At some point in the future this option will default to off.

## I found a bug. How do I report it?
