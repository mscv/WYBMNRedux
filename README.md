WYBMNRedux
=======================

## What is WYBMNRedux?

WYBMNRedux is a rewrite of the abandoned [WillYouBeMyNeighbor] (http://www.curse.com/ws-addons/wildstar/221549-willyoubemyneighbor). It has been rewritten from the ground up with one singular goal in mind: PERFORMANCE.

Even though the original addon still works as of this writing, it has long since been abandoned and is currently suffering from a number of performance issues. WYBMNRedux tries to alleviate that both by utilising a somewhat optimised code and logic as well as greatly reducing the addon communication channel spam.

## How do I use it?

You can install the add-on from Curse using either the website or the Curse client.
After the add-on has been installed, you can show or hide the window by typing '/wybmnr' in the chat.

You can configure the add-on by choosing 'Configure' in the addon list under WYBMNRedux or clicking an appropriate button in the addon gui itself.

## I found a bug. How do I report it?

Please report any bugs as a Github issue [here](https://github.com/mscv/WYBMNRedux/issues).

## I want to contribute to the add-on. How do I start?

If you want to contribute to the development of the add-on, start by [forking](https://github.com/mscv/WYBMNRedux/fork) the main repository.

After making the contributions in your forked repository, please submit a [pull request](https://github.com/mscv/WYBMNRedux/pulls) back to the main project.
